<h1>Why I love Greys Anatomy</h1>
  <h2>By:Devany Zetina</h2>
  <p>One may ask as to why I decided to write all about my favorite show, which if you couldn't tell is "Greys Anatomy". But if I'm being honest, a lot of people don't understand that this show is really important to me. It allowed me to see how going into the medical field was my calling. I know that the show is more drama but many of the stories are inspired by real people and I think that it's beautiful. The show is filled with amazing characters who are played by amazing actors and actresses. It depicts not exactly real life scenarios but just enough to say "wow that's amazing". The chracters have been building over the course of 15 years, and the show gets better and better each season. One other thing I really love about this show is the fact that they don't depict the lives of these characters to be all puppies and rainvows all the time. They depict them to have really hard lives and are often faced with obstacles, I personally wouldn't know how to cope with.<p>
